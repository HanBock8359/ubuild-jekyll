    Android Studio is the Tim Hortons of software consistency</p><p><strong>What took
    the most time? The least? Any surprises? </strong></p><p>Kevin: Setting up HSQLDB
    took us the most time. Making a presentation video took the least time (and surprisingly
    my voice sounds very different from I hear).</p><p><strong>Did any features work
    better than expected? </strong></p><p>Eriq: The logout button always worked.</p><p><strong>Can
    you draw any conclusions from what youâ€™ve done? </strong></p><p>Andrea: Diving
    headfirst to Android Studio(with its mediocre documentation) and learning the
    strings from scratch is not an easy feat. Our team took great risks implementing
    functionalities our way and meddling with unfamiliar libraries. Next time, we
    should remember that a sample project exists and that we should just copy its
    existing patterns</p>"
